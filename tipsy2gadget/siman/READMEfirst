This file contains information on how to compile and run convsim, 
which converts tipsy files to gadget format. 

This is a stripped down version of SIMAN derived from Andrew Pontzen's
distribution.

CONVSIM

1) For the purpose of most users, the following are the practical 
steps to take:
	a) type "./configure --prefix=pathname", where pathname is the 
directory in which the following installation will take place (i.e., 
directories and final executables will be buried in this path).  If 
you are installing as root, you can just type ./configure.  However, 
I assume this won't be the case for most users.  (More detailed 
installation instructions can then be found in siman/INSTALLATION.)
	b) type "make"
	c) type "make install".  This will place the final executables 
in the directory named bin, which was created in the process.

2) You must then ensure your paths are set up correctly, which 
generally will involve adding to your .cshrc.personal (or equivalent):
setenv PATH=$PATH:~/bin
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv C_INCLUDE_PATH ~/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH ~/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

3) If all has gone appropriate, you are now ready to run convsim and 
convert from tipsy to gadget format.  (If something has gone wrong, you 
will either need to locate a local C++ expert, or write to the author 
of the code, Andrew Pontzen: app26@ast.cam.ac.uk)
	a) In the directory where convsim is located, you will need a 
file titled "tipsy.units" that tells convsim how to convert from 
simulation units to real units.  This file contains one line, e.g.:
(2.85714e4 kpc a) (3.1715e15 msol) (691.4 km s^-1) (135.98 msol kpc^-3) (km^2 s^-2)
would be the appropriate input for Fabio's 512 runs, where the first 
input gives the comoving length unit, second is the mass unit, and 
third is the velocity unit.  The last two inputs shouldn't need to be 
altered.
	b) To run convsim, type "convsim gadget simdir/sim" where 
simdir points to the directory the simulation is located in, and sim is 
the timestep that you wish to convert to a gadget file. 
	c) Convsim has two outputs - a gadget file and a file called 
sim".gadget.units".  The gadget file is simply the name of the input 
simulation with ".gadget" appended to it.  The second file is just a 
reference, which gives the units that have been written into the gadget 
file (for instance, AMIGA expects the gadget length unit to be in 
kpc*a*h^-1, and the mass unit to be in 1e10*h^-1 M_sun; for more info 
the reader is referred to the Gadget user's manual).
