READING:

Emma's thesis intro for background? (see webpage)
Max's Project: Cooke, J - Spectroscopic selection... , ApJ 2005 621 596
"Stellar Masses and Star Formation Histories of Galaxies at z~6..."
  a-ph/0604554
In Buyle 2006 - Nagashima & Yoshii semi-analytic model for HI/B relation

After Discussion with Emma re HI/B relation - 
	Allen 2002/3


HI at Z=0:

* Andrew West PhD thesis - Julianne Dalcanton's Student - HI/mgal relation
* Stacey McGough (?)



CORE PROJECT REMINDER:

*Is a forming MW-like galaxy a typical DLA?*

1. Do galaxies have a sensible HI distribution at z=0 - NO!

2. Where was HI currently in the disk at earlier times?
3. Column density/impact parameter at high z
4. Kinematic properties (requires metallicities!)

Side-questions (technical)

a. How accurate does the RT need to be?
b. Dust absorption
c. Metals

OBS POINTS:

Use Schechter fn to understand whether there *could* be a correlation
between MHI and Magnitude.


IF CONTINUING AT ANY POINT WITH THICK RADIATIVE:


* Think of some CLOUDY comparison tests
* See what effect changing grid resolution and region size has
  (guessing the latter could be more important at higher z)
