CODING JOBS:

* Why is parallel CIonise::thickRadiative() not working properly?
* Implement better units reading
* Scripting - decide on mechanism and sort it

DATA:

* UV normalization was done quickly. Need to sort out x-sections
in CIonise then RECALCULATE data/UVNORM


SCIENCE:

* Correct through-put of redshift from CTipsyFile etc.
* Milky way 1024/512 comparison at various redshifts
* Mark particles contributing to DLA at various redshifts and pass
  to Alyson
* 

CALLIBRATION & CHECKING:

* Think of some CLOUDY comparison tests
* See what effect changing grid resolution and region size has
  (guessing the latter could be more important at higher z)
* 

INSTALLATION:

Current chain of commands:

aclocal
automake -a
libtoolize
autoconf
automake
make

 - a little long? 

CORE PROJECT REMINDER:

*Is a forming MW-like galaxy a typical DLA?*

1. Do galaxies have a sensible HI distribution at z=0
2. Where was HI currently in the disk at earlier times
3. Column density/impact parameter at high z
4. Kinematic properties (requires metallicities!)

Side-questions (technical)

a. How accurate does the RT need to be?
